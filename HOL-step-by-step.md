### Task 6: On-Demand Query: Azure Data Lake Gen2

Every Azure Synapse Analytics workspace comes with SQL on-demand endpoints that you can use to query data in the lake. SQL on-demand is a query service over the data in your data lake. It is a distributed data processing system, built for large scale of data and compute. SQL on-demand enables you to analyze your Big Data in seconds to minutes, depending on the workload. Thanks to built-in query execution fault-tolerance, the system provides high reliability and success rates even for long-running queries involving large data sets.

SQL on-demand is serverless; hence there is no infrastructure to setup or clusters to maintain. A default endpoint for this service is provided within every Azure Synapse workspace, so you can start querying data as soon as the workspace is created. There is no charge for resources reserved. You are only being charged for the data scanned by queries you run; hence this model is a true pay-per-use model.

In this task, we will query twitter data stored as Parquet files in Azure Data Lake Gen 2 using SQL On-Demand, and visualize the result.

1. Select **Data** Hub from the left navigation in the Synapse Analytics workspace. From the **Data** blade, select **Linked** tab and under **Storage accounts**, Select/expand the storage account starting with **asaexpworkspace**. Observe data sources that are now in ADL Gen2 and then select **twitterdata** storage container.

![](media/2020-04-10_17-00-38.png)

2. See all the parquet files and other folders in the **twitterdata** container. Select the first two parquet files and right-click, from the context menu, Select **New SQL Script** and then select **Select TOP 100 rows**.

![](media/2020-04-10_17-01-49.png)

3. Select **Run**.

![](media/2020-04-11_11-26-50.png)

![](media/2020-04-11_11-29-17.png)

### Task 7: COPY INTO Command

One of the options to load data into Azure Synapse to be used in SQL queries is the COPY statement that helps to load data from external storage accounts. The COPY statement provides the most flexibility for high-throughput data ingestion into Azure Synapse. In this task, we will load twitter data storage in Azure Storage and run a query against it with the COPY INTO command.

1. Select **Develop**, then expand **SQL Scripts** to list all available scripts. Select **8 External Data to Synapse Via Copy Into** and highlight the query presented below titled **Step:1**.

![](media/2020-04-10_17-06-50.png)

## Exercise 4: Visualizing the data using the Power BI dashboard

As you evaluate tools to find the right amount of power, flexibility, this exercise will introduce you to a PowerBI Dashboard that brings data sources from various reports. You will have the chance to look into every report one by one directly in Power BI.

Duration: 20 minutes.

### Task 1: Access Data and AI Demo Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard is a single page, often called a canvas, that uses visualizations to tell a story. Because it is limited to one page, a well-designed dashboard contains only the most-important elements of that story. 

The visualizations you will see on the dashboard are called tiles and are pinned to the dashboard by report designers. In most cases, selecting a tile takes you to the report page where the visualization was created. During the next tasks we will look at various reports that are linked to our dashboard called `Data and AI Demo Dashboard`.

1. Sign in to the [Power BI Portal](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) using your Azure credentials.

2. From the hamburger menu select **Workspaces** to access the list of workspaces available to you. Select the workspace named `ASA-EXP`.

### Task 2: Campaign Analytics Report

A Power BI report is a multi-perspective view into a dataset, with visuals that represent different findings and insights from that dataset. The visuals aren't static. They update as the underlying data changes. You can interact with the visuals and filters as you dig into the data to discover insights and look for answers. Like a dashboard, a report is highly interactive and highly customizable.

During the next couple of tasks we will look at various reports that are linked to our original dashboard called `Data and AI Demo Dashboard`.
