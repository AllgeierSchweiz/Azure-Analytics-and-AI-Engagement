### Task 6: On Demand Query: Azure Data Lake Gen2

Every Azure Synapse Analytics workspace comes with SQL on-demand endpoints that you can use to query data in the lake. SQL on-demand is a query service over the data in your data lake. It is a distributed data processing system, built for large scale of data and compute. SQL on-demand enables you to analyze your Big Data in seconds to minutes, depending on the workload. Thanks to built-in query execution fault-tolerance, the system provides high reliability and success rates even for long-running queries involving large data sets.

SQL on-demand is serverless, hence there is no infrastructure to setup or clusters to maintain. A default endpoint for this service is provided within every Azure Synapse workspace, so you can start querying data as soon as the workspace is created. There is no charge for resources reserved, you are only being charged for the data scanned by queries you run, hence this model is a true pay-per-use model.

In this task, we will query twitter data stored as Parquet files in Azure Data Lake Gen 2 using SQL On-Demand, and visualize the result.

1. Select **Data** Hub from the left navigation in the Synapse Analytics workspace. From the **Data** blade, under **Storage accounts**, Select/expand **daidemosynapsestorageforgen2**.
