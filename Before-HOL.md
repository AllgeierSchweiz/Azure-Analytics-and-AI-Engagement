# Azure Synapse Analytics WWI lab setup guide

## Requirements

1. An Azure Account with the ability to create an Azure Synapse Workspace
2. A PowerBI Pro or Premium account to host Power BI reports.

## Before the hands-on lab

### Task 1: Create a resource group in Azure

1. Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) using your Azure credentials.

2. On the Azure Portal home screen, select the **+ Create a resource** tile.

    ![A portion of the Azure Portal home screen is displayed with the + Create a resource tile highlighted.](media/bhol_createaresource.png)

3. In the **Search the Marketplace** text box, type **Resource group** and press the **Enter** key.

    ![On the new resource screen Resource group is entered as a search term.](media/bhol_searchmarketplaceresourcegroup.png)

4. Select the **Create** button on the **Resource group** overview page.

5. On the **Create a resource group** screen, select your desired Subscription and Region. For Resource group, enter **Synapse-WWI-Lab**, then select the **Review + Create** button.

    ![The Create a resource group form is displayed populated with Synapse-MCW as the resource group name.](media/bhol_resourcegroupform.png)

6. Select the **Create** button once validation has passed.

### Task 2: Create Azure Synapse Analytics workspace

1. Deploy the workspace through the following Azure ARM template (press the button below):

    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsolliancenet%2Fazure-synapse-wwi-lab%2Fmaster%2Fartifacts%2Fenvironment-setup%2Fautomation%2F00-asa-workspace-core.json%3Ftoken%3DAAWYR62FS2TMH3GYFSFQE2263X2AM" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png" /></a>

2. On the **Custom deployment** form, select your desired subscription and select **Synapse-WWI-Lab** for the **Resource group**. Also provide a **Unique Suffix** such as your initials followed by birth year. Finally, provide a strong **SQL Administrator Login Password**. Remember this password value, you'll be needing it!

    ![The Custom deployment form is displayed with example data populated.](media/bhol_customdeploymentform.png)
  
    > **Important**: The `location` field under 'Settings' will list the Azure regions where Azure Synapse Analytics (Preview) is available as of June 2020. This will help you find a region where the service is available without being limited to where the resource group is defined.

3. Check the **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**, then select the **Purchase** button.

    > **Note**: You may experience a deployment step failing in regards to Role Assignment. This error may safely be ignored.

### Task 3: Download lab artifacts

1. In a web browser, navigate to the [MCW Azure Synapse Analytics WWI Lab repository](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-synapse-wwi-lab).

2. Expand the **Clone or download** button, and select **Download Zip**.

    ![On the repository screen, the Clone or download button is expanded and the Download Zip button is highlighted.](media/bhol_downloadzip.png)

3. Extract the downloaded zip file to the location of your choice.

### Task 4: Create a local settings file

1. On your local machine, create a folder **C:\LabFiles**. Inside this folder, create a new file named **AzureCreds.ps1**. In this file, you will set parameters necessary to complete the workspace setup.

    ```PowerShell
    $AzureUserName = "<enter your azure username>"
    $AzurePassword = "<enter your azure password>"
    $TokenGeneratorClientId = "1950a258-227b-4e31-a9cf-717495945fc2"
    $AzureSQLPassword = "<enter the same password you chose when deploying the workspace>"
    $Load30Billion = 0
    ```

When the `$Load30Billion` variable is set to `1` the script will scale your SQLPool to `DW3000c` and populate the database with 30 billion records that will be used as part of exercise during the lab. The approx load time for the data set is 4 hours. When the variable is left at 0 the total data size will be 3 million records.

### Task 5: Run environment setup PowerShell scripts

1. Open **Visual Studio Code** and open the folder to where you extracted the lab files (extracted in Task 3). **Be sure to run this application as Administrator**.

2. Open **artifacts/environment-setup/automation/01-environment-setup.ps1**.

3. Open a Terminal Window (ctrl + shift + `). Ensure **PowerShell** or **PowerShell Integrated Console** is selected on the Terminal pane toolbar.

    ![The Visual Studio Code terminal toolbar is displayed with the PowerShell Integrated Console item selected.](media/bhol_powershellintegratedselection.png)

4. Change the directory to the **automation** folder.

    ```PowerShell
    cd '.\artifacts\environment-setup\automation'
    ```

5. In the editor window, select the entire script (ctrl + a), then right-click and select **Run selection** _OR_ you may press **F8** to run the selection.

    ![The Visual Studio Code editor window is shown with a script file contents fully selected and the right-click context menu expanded with the Run selection option highlighted.](media/bhol_selectallrun.png)

    > **Note**: if you see an error regarding `No modules were removed` or `Uninstall-AzureRm`, it is safe to ignore. If the script pauses for prompts, enter the `A` (Yes to All) option.

    > **Note**: if you experience script failures, it may be beneficial to highlight only the lines preceding the `$InformationPreference = "Continue"` line and run them separately from the rest of the script. Some people have experienced the console not stopping for user input when importing from the PowerShell Gallery.

6. Open **artifacts/environment-setup/automation/02-powerbi-setup.ps1**. Repeat steps from 3 to 5 to run the script file.

7. Sign in into the [Power BI Portal](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) using your Azure credentials. 

8. From the hamburger menu select **Workspaces** to access the list of workspaces available to you. Select the workspace named `ASA-EXP`.

![The workspaces button from the hamburger menu is selected to list workspaces available. The ASA-EXP workspace is selected.](media/powerbi_workspace_selection.png)

8. Select the **Settings** icon from the top right bar, and select **Settings** again to navigate to the settings page. 

![The settings button on the Power BI portal clicked and the Settings selection on the context menu selected.](media/powerbi_settings_menu.png)

9. Select **datasets* tab to access the list of datasets available. Then select `2-Billion Rows Demo` dataset to access its settings. From the settings page open **Data source credentials** and select **Edit credentials**.

![The datasets tab is selected. From the list of datasets 2-Billion Rows Demo is selected. Edit credentials will be selected next. ](media/powerbi_datasource_credentials.png)

9. Select **OAuth2** for the **Authentication method** and select **Sign In** to complete the process.

![From the list of authentication methods OAuth2 is picked. The sign in button is selected. ](media/powerbi_datasource_credentials-update.png)

You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
