In a previous [solution accelerator](https://databricks.com/blog/2021/01/19/combining-rules-based-and-ai-models-to-combat-financial-fraud.html), we addressed the problem of blending rules with AI in a common orchestration layer powered by MLFlow. In this series of notebooks centered around geospatial analytics, we demonstrate how Lakehouse enables organizations to better understand customers behaviours, no longer based on who they are, but how they bank, no longer using a one-size-fits-all rule but a truly personalized AI. After all, identifying abnormal patterns can only be made possible if one first understands what a normal behaviour is, and doing so for millions of customers becomes a challenge that requires both data and AI combined into one platform. As part of this solution, we are releasing a new open source geospatial library, [GEOSCAN](https://github.com/databrickslabs/geoscan), to detect geospatial behaviours at massive scale, track customers patterns over time and detect anomalous card transactions*\n\n---\n+ <a href=\"https://databricks.com/notebooks/geoscan/00_geofraud_context.html\">STAGE0</a>: Home page\n+ <a href=\"https://databricks.com/notebooks/geoscan/01_geofraud_clustering.html\">STAGE1</a>: Using a novel approach to geospatial clustering with H3\n+ <a href=\"https://databricks.com/notebooks/geoscan/02_geofraud_fraud.html\">STAGE2</a>: Detecting anomalous transactions as ML enriched rules\n---\n<antoine.amend@databricks.com>"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"cc3b8c74-f097-4df8-9c4a-a2e55056459f"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["displayHTML(\"\"\"<iframe src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QEqsofS2qBELW3lJrwT740K5FGxiZrDV/preview\"></iframe>\"\"\")\n"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"3b5e6750-a310-476f-ad46-58a8ee178e25"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"datasetInfos":[],"data":"<iframe src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QEqsofS2qBELW3lJrwT740K5FGxiZrDV/preview\"></iframe>","textData":null,"removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"metadata":{},"type":"htmlSandbox","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<iframe src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QEqsofS2qBELW3lJrwT740K5FGxiZrDV/preview\"></iframe>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Context\nIn the first notebook, we introduce [GEOSCAN](https://github.com/databrickslabs/geoscan), a novel approach to geospatial clustering.
